# Coral AI üê† - Chat with any PDF

Coral AI is a full-stack AI-powered web application that allows you to have interactive conversations with your PDF documents. Simply upload a PDF and start asking questions to get summaries, find information, and understand the content faster.

## About The Project

This project transforms the way we interact with PDF documents. Instead of manually sifting through pages of text, Coral AI allows you to "chat" with your documents. It leverages a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

The application is built with a modern tech stack, featuring a Next.js frontend and a robust backend that handles file processing, AI-powered analysis, and user management. When a user uploads a PDF, the document is securely stored on AWS S3, its content is processed and converted into vector embeddings using Google's Generative AI, and then stored in a Pinecone vector database for efficient searching.

### Features

-   **Interactive PDF Chat**: Ask questions and get answers directly from your PDF documents.
-   **Secure File Uploads**: Upload your PDF files, which are securely stored on AWS S3.
-   **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and management with Clerk.
-   **Subscription Management**: Pro features and subscription management handled by Stripe.
-   **Chat History**: All your conversations are saved, allowing you to pick up where you left off.
-   **PDF Viewer**: View your PDF document alongside the chat interface for easy reference.
